\subsection*{Algorithm Description}

The 2-opt algorithm is a simple local search algorithm that has application to solve the traveling salesman problem. The main idea behind it is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder that route so that it no longer overlaps. We encountered this algorithm through it's Wikipedia article \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt}.

\subsection*{Algorithm Discussion}

A brief discussion of why you chose this algorithm.

I chose this algorithm because:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It was conceptually easy to implement
	\item It is relatively efficient to compute the path improvement for a given path swap, which means it can be run quickly
	\item Our other algorithms were constructive, while 2-OPT is a local search heuristic (it improves upon an existing path)
	\item Related to above, this means we can combine 2-OPT with an efficient constructive algorithm (nearest neighbor in this case)
\end{itemize}
