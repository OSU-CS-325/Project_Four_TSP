\subsection*{Algorithm Description}

The 2-opt algorithm is a simple local search algorithm that has application to solve the traveling salesman problem. The main idea behind it is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder that route so that it no longer overlaps. We encountered this algorithm through it's Wikipedia article \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt}.

\subsection*{Algorithm Discussion}

A brief discussion of why you chose this algorithm.
