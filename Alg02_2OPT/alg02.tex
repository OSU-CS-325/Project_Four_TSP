\subsection*{Algorithm Description}

The 2-opt algorithm is a simple local search algorithm that has application to solve the traveling salesman problem. The main idea behind it is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder that route so that it no longer overlaps. We encountered this algorithm through it's Wikipedia article \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt}.

\subsection*{Algorithm Discussion}

We decided on this algorithm because it was easy to implement conceptually. Also the algorithm is relatively efficient to compute the path improvement for a given path swap which provides for a favorable runtime. The other algorithms we wrote up were constructive while 2-OPT is a local search heuristic meaning it improves on an exisiting path. Because 2-OPT is a local search heuristic it needs to be combined with an efficient constructive algorithm which we choose nearest neighbor.

    improved = true
    old_tour_length = tour_length

    while improved:
        improved = false
        exit_early = false

        for i = 1 to num_pts - 1 and not exit_early:
            for j = i + 1 to num_pts - 1 and not exit_early:
                old_tour_length = tour_length

                    improved = true
                    exit_early = true

                    write the improved tour to file
