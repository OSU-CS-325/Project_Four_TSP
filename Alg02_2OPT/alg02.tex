These sections are the minimum of what we need to cover based on the Project 4 guidelines. Feel free to add additional sections!

% The asterix after \subsection disables section numbering
\subsection*{Algorithm Description}

A description of the algorithm, and a summary of the research performed. I'd like to recommend we use BibTeX here to keep track of our sources, and make referencing easy. In the report directory, you'll find a \verb|report.bib| file. In that file, you can add your sources. Then to cite a source, you use the \verb|\cite{citationName}| command. Check out the section titled ``3 Bibliography management with Bibtex" in the referenced website to see how it works. \cite{bibtex} References appear at the end of the report PDF.

\subsection*{Algorithm Discussion}

A brief discussion of why you chose this algorithm.

\subsection*{Algorithm Pseudo-code}

\begin{algorithmic}
\If {$i\geq maxval$}
    \State $i\gets 0$
\Else
    \If {$i+k\leq maxval$}
        \State $i\gets i+k$
    \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
